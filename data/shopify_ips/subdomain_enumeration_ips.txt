# NOTES
# ======================================
# - 10.90.x.x IPs are private/internal (RFC1918) - may not be useful for external reverse DNS
# - 104.18.x.x and 172.64.x.x are Cloudflare IPs (likely proxied, not store infrastructure)
# - 34.148.x.x is GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
# - 44.196.x.x is AWS (Amazon Web Services)
# 
# RECOMMENDATION:
# Focus reverse DNS efforts on:
# - 34.148.253.105 (GCP - may host stores)
# - 44.196.20.225 (AWS - may host stores)
# 
# Skip:
# - 10.90.x.x (internal/private IPs)
# - 104.18.x.x and 172.64.x.x (Cloudflare CDN, not store hosting)
